From the moment we arrived (my roommate and I), we loved the apartment. It's larger than the pictures show and really accommodating for two people (or two couples or a family) to live in. The AC is incredible (we worked from home during the summer at this spot/WIFI was also great) and were really grateful for such powerful AC throughout whenever needed. Another HUGE PLUS are the dishwasher and the washer/dryer in unit. These really make the difference. There was everything we could ask for in the kitchen and the rooms were fully stocked with enough blankets and linens to feel at home. The LOCATION is another 10/10. The UWS is close enough to Midtown and downtown or UES that a subway ride can get you there but far enough that you feel like you're going home from the hustle and bustle of everything every night. I had a favorite book shop all the way in the lower east side and I found it really manageable to travel there and back to the apartment. Additionally the surrounding restaurants (Amity Hall for its\nbottomless brunches and great eggs benedict, Hungarian pastry shop for people watching, 1020 bar for a late drink, living thai down the street and a great sushi spot on the other corner) all make this location IDEAL. Plus you have Columbia just a short 7 - 9 minute walk. I wish I could rave more about this great Airbnb experience. OH and Jenny is great. She responds to everything and anything. She is constantly available and is really great to chat with! We loved our stay!!\nShow more"", ""LaKeasha\nDecember 2020\nJenny's place was a great place to stay and have a small gathering.

I am excited to be renting my 2-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. The apartment is a 2-bedroom with the rooms on opposite sides, so there is plenty of privacy. The bedroom is bright, airy, and has access to a fire escape (for anyone who smokes...). The kitchen is fully equipped, and you are more than welcome to use anything you find to cook yourself a wonderful dinner or just to grab coffee on your way out for sightseeing. \n\nI am a very easy-going freelance writer/editor. I love meeting new people and consider myself a sort of ""ambassador"" of my city. I have lived here for nearly 3 years - long enough to have some insight, but still new enough to enjoy the sights and offer any advice to travelers.\n\nThe neighborhood is great - tons of things to do but still on a quiet block so you can relax after a long day of sightseeing. Below are just a few of the many sights to see nearby my apartment: \n\n-2 blocks from Central Park \n-1 block from St. John\'s Cathedral \n-Apollo Theatre in Harlem \n-Columbia University \n-Riverside Park \n-Metropolitan Opera \n-Julliard School \n-Lincoln Center \n-New York Ballet \n\nThese are just a few of the many sights that are all either within walking distance or only a few subway stops. I am located 2 blocks away from the 1, B, and C trains which all connect to express lines making it very easy to get anywhere in the city. \n\nI can\'t wait to hear from you and am happy to answer any questions about the apartment or neighborhood, or New York in general!\nShow more\nWhere you\'ll sleep\nBedroom 1\n1 queen bed\nBedroom 2\n1 double bed\nLiving room\n1 sofa bed\nWhat this place offers\nKitchen\nWifi\nFree street parking\nTV\nWasher\nDryer\nAir conditioning\nLuggage dropoff allowed\nHair dryer\nRefrigerator\nShow all 32 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$77\n / night\n$77 per night\n4.47\n(84 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.47 out of 5 stars from 84 reviews\n4.47 · 84 reviews\nCleanliness\n4.3\nAccuracy\n4.5\nCommunication\n4.8\nLocation\n4.7\nCheck-in\n4.8\nValue\n4.4\nAnastasia\nAugust 2021\nIf you are considering staying in NYC the weekend or for a few months and are considering this place, choose it!! From the moment we arrived (my roommate and I), we loved the apartment. It\'s larger than the pictures show and really accommodating for two people (or two couples or a family) to live in. The AC is incredible (we worked from home during the summer at this spot/WIFI was also great) and were really grateful for such powerful AC throughout whenever needed. Another HUGE PLUS are the dishwasher and the washer/dryer in unit. These really make the difference. There was everything we could ask for in the kitchen and the rooms were fully stocked with enough blankets and linens to feel at home. The LOCATION is another 10/10. The UWS is close enough to Midtown and downtown or UES that a subway ride can get you there but far enough that you feel like you\'re going home from the hustle and bustle of everything every night. I had a favorite book shop all the way in the lower east side and I found it really manageable to travel there and back to the apartment. Additionally the surrounding restaurants (Amity Hall for its\nbottomless brunches and great eggs benedict, Hungarian pastry shop for people watching, 1020 bar for a late drink, living thai down the street and a great sushi spot on the other corner) all make this location IDEAL.

Loved the location and the accommodations :) Thank you Musa for everything!!\nSergio\nOctober 2021\nClean, accurate, cozy and close to everything. This is a perfect place to spend a couple of days in the city. Literally 5 minute walking from the subway and even a supermarket around the corner of you like doing groceries for your stay. Cannot recommend it enough.\nShow more\nAmy\nSeptember 2021\nGreat little place to stay IF you are a low maintenance kind of person, which I thought I was. The bathroom situation here proved otherwise. I just couldn’t get over having to think about all the things required to use a communal toilet. (Have to pee in the middle of the night? Put on some shoes, grab your roll of toilet paper and go across the hallway. Then touch a doorknob that countless people have touched after using the toilet, come back and wash your hands in your kitchen sink.) All that toilet stuff aside, I still think it’s an amazing value. You can’t beat the location. Air conditioning was great at providing cold air and white noise simultaneously. Very quiet room, as the windows don’t face the street. The room was overall clean, but there were some stains on the sheets, the towels didn’t smell super fresh, and the kitchen sponge smelled moldy. Musa was wonderful with communication and wi-fi worked great. I’d definitely recommend this place to people who aren’t as germaphobic as I apparently am. :)\nShow more\nCaleb\nSeptember 2021\nThis is not a ""beautiful, cozy"" studio. The studio is located in a decrepit building that is beyond serious need of renovation. I personally did not feel safe here. Seriously, this makes my freshman dorm in college look like luxury. I feel woefully misled as the pictures and description make it seem like a reasonable place to stay.\n\nThere are pros though. Great location! Musa communicated quickly and clearly. But I cannot give this place anything above a 1 star review because of the misleading description and the uncomfortable stay.\nShow more', '78 Reviews\nIdentity verified\n\U000f0003\nSuperhost', ""Things to know\nHouse rules\nCheck-in: After 3:00 PM\nCheckout: 11:00 AM\nSelf check-in with lockbox\nNot suitable for infants (under 2 years)\nNo smoking\nNo pets\nNo parties or events\nShow more\nHealth & safety\n\U000f9001\nCommitted to Airbnb's enhanced cleaning process.

The building is over 100 years old, but the apartment is newly renovated.\n\nGetting around is super convenient— just 7 minutes walking to 3 subway lines! The unique location at the intersection of 3 iconic Brooklyn neighborhoods-- Bed Stuy, Williamsburg, and Bushwick-- allowing for easy walking exploration and a quick commute to Downtown Manhattan.\n\nThere are fantastic views of the Empire State Building from the guest room. The bed is very comfortable!\n\nThe kitchen is fully equipped— stove, fridge, dishwasher, toaster oven, french press, pans, utensils, spices, olive oil, tea & coffee. You are welcome to use all of this! (Please note I do not have a microwave.)\n\nThe shower is nice and warm with good water pressure.\n\nLaundry is conveniently located in the basement.\n\nThe building allows rooftop access if you would like to check out the view and enjoy the fresh air.\nShow more\nWhere you'll sleep\nBedroom\n1 single bed\nWhat this place offers\nCity skyline view\nKitchen\nWifi\nFree street parking\nWasher – In building\nDryer – In building\nAir conditioning\nShared patio or balcony\nLuggage dropoff allowed\nSecurity cameras on property\nShow all 39 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$55\n / night\n$55 per night\n4.93\n(227 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.93 out of 5 stars from 227 reviews\n4.93 · 227 reviews\nCleanliness\n4.9\nAccuracy\n5.0\nCommunication\n5.0\nLocation\n4.7\nCheck-in\n4.9\nValue\n4.9\nMorgan\nNovember 2021\nKaitlyn’s place is clean and welcoming.

Live like a local at this cozy studio apartment. Located inside a historic NYC brownstone nestled in one of Manhattan\'s greatest neighborhoods, Murray Hill. The apartments are small but well designed to maximize the usage of the space. The units re equipped with a private bathroom, comfortable bed, Cable TV, a work space, a fully loaded micro-kitchen, and some closet space. It is the perfect place for a single guest looking for full privacy.\n\n\nOur studios offers our guests the perfect solution to all of New York City\'s lodging hassles... Price, location, & privacy. With us you can have your own place, in a Manhattan\'s upscale and central location, at an affordable price!\n\nThe Apartments\nThe units are small (which NYC apartment isn\'t right?) but well equipped with all the amenities needed for a comfortable long stay. The Micro-Kitchen may be tiny but it is fully loaded to bring the inner chef out of you. The comfortable bed will guarantee a good night sleep after a long day out on the city. We provide free Wi-Fi and basic cable TV for you to stay connected with the outside world and the private bathroom has an eclectic feel to it and will provide full privacy to feel comfortable with added open closet space to keep you organized.\n\nThe building\nOur unit is located in a beautiful 1930\'s historic building that will provide you with a true New York experience. So please keep in mind that this classic building, which is a better word for older, is well maintained but lacks certain amenities that became more popular years after its creation. The Building has an elevator and stairs so you can choose whether to get some extra exercise or not.\n\nThe Neighborhood\nOne of the best features of our studio is its location. Step out of the door and enjoy the beautiful tree-lined streets of Murray Hill. With plenty of cute cafes, restaurants, bars, and local shops to suit any needs you may have. This upscale but young and hip neighborhood puts you within walking distance of pretty much anywhere you may need to be, or at most a fast subway trip away from it.\nShow more\nWhere you\'ll sleep\nBedroom area\n1 double bed\nWhat this place offers\nKitchen\nWifi\nTV with standard cable\nAir conditioning\nRefrigerator\nDedicated workspace\nLong term stays allowed\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nShow all 20 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$85\n / night\n$85 per night\n4.44\n(39 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.44 out of 5 stars from 39 reviews\n4.44 · 39 reviews\nCleanliness\n4.5\nAccuracy\n4.4\nCommunication\n4.7\nLocation\n4.9\nCheck-in\n4.6\nValue\n4.6\nMehboob\nNovember 2021\nGood Apartment at great location.

Plus, there’s a cute cat that hangouts downstairs (I’m allergic and didn’t have any problem). What’s not to love??\nShow more\nWilliam\nOctober 2021\nNo problems at all. Check in was very easy with detailed instructions and the room was just as described. Transportation was extremely easy into the city. If you are driving (which I would never recommend in New York anyway), parking is a bit of a problem. There is free street parking but finding spots is no picnic.

I would definitely say you are paying for what you get; however, there was an usual smell coming from the kitchen and my friend and I noticed it was from the trash that had been full since our arrival until we had left.

No. It’s much smaller in person and you would think this Airbnb was meant for one person only because of how small the room is.

The place was extremely clean and well appointed with essentials. There was even fresh creamer in the fridge for coffee! The bed is VERY comfortable too.

He even let us leave our luggage to a later time because our flight was not until 6:30pm. :) Also, the aesthetics of the room (and bathroom as well) are on point, very minimalist style (which I love!).

In the past visits, we have only stayed at hotels in Midtown. Venturing out and staying in the Lower East Side was a great way to experience the city like a local. I will say that there are some homeless folks right outside the front stoop and they do congregate on the sidewalk. I don't recommend venturing out alone at night, but if you have someone with you it will be fine. As far at the accommodations, they were really fantastic! The place was extremely clean and well appointed with essentials. There was even fresh creamer in the fridge for coffee! The bed is VERY comfortable too.

This cozy queen size private bedroom has a true city feeling, only a few minutes walk to the Empire State Building! The apartment is right in the heart of Manhattan, near Grand Central, Korea Town, Murray Hill, Madison Square Park and much more.

The apartment is in the center of New York City, near the subway station, bus stops, and near the empire state, lots of restaurants and shops around to explore and enjoy. Two people per room, but if there's more than two then I can offer sleeping bags ($30 per extra person), the room may be big enough to fit more; or they can sleep in the living room if needed. I also rent other extra rooms on this platform, same apartment.

During times when people typically eat, it was hard to get out of there navigating around all the people. Getting to work in the morning was easy though because it's nearly empty at 7am. Prince street pizza nearby and Taim are the best! Make sure Jeniffer uploads the right pictures for you in advance and tells you the exact square feet so you know what to expect (we didn't know because she never directly answered this question, and also accidentally uploaded the wrong pictures and told us about it right before our move in, even though we booked months in advance.)

The apartments are small but well designed to maximize the usage of the space. The units re equipped with a private bathroom, comfortable bed, basic cable TV, a micro-kitchen, and plenty of open closet space. It is the perfect place for a single guest looking for full privacy.\n\n\nOur studios offers our guests the perfect solution to all of New York City's lodging hassles... Price, location, & privacy. With us you can have your own place, in a Manhattan's upscale and central location, at an affordable price!\n\nThe Apartments\nThe units are small (which NYC apartment isn't right?) but well equipped with all the amenities needed for a comfortable long stay. The Micro-Kitchen may be tiny but it is loaded to bring the inner chef out of you. The comfortable bed will guarantee a good night sleep after a long day out on the city. We provide free Wi-Fi and basic cable TV for you to stay connected with the outside world and the private bathroom has an eclectic feel to it and will provide full privacy to feel comfortable with added open closet space to keep you organized.\n\nThe building\nOur unit is located in a beautiful 1930's historic building that will provide you with a true New York experience. So please keep in mind that this classic building, which is a better word for older, is well maintained but lacks certain amenities that became more popular years after its creation. Stairs are a must, as there is not an elevator in the building and the A/C's are located on the windows.\n\nThe Neighborhood\nOne of the best features of our studio is its location. Step out of the door and enjoy the beautiful tree-lined streets of Murray Hill. With plenty of cute cafes, restaurants, bars, and local shops to suit any needs you may have. This upscale but young and hip neighborhood puts you within walking distance of pretty much anywhere you may need to be, or at most a fast subway trip away from it.\nShow more\nWhere you'll sleep\nBedroom area\n1 double bed\nWhat this place offers\nKitchen\nWifi\nFree street parking\nTV with standard cable\nAir conditioning\nMicrowave\nDedicated workspace\nLong term stays allowed\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nShow all 21 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$85\n / night\n$85 per night\n4.37\n(60 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.37 out of 5 stars from 60 reviews\n4.37 · 60 reviews\nCleanliness\n4.3\nAccuracy\n4.6\nCommunication\n4.5\nLocation\n4.8\nCheck-in\n4.7\nValue\n4.2\nMelody\nOctober 2021\nI’ve stayed at another one of their properties and I find it a bit hit or miss.

My last stay was great. The place was clean, fresh linens, centrally located. This stay was a bit of a disappointment however. I arrived to only one towel so needed to call for the extras. The place was also incredibly dirty, with dust in every corner and weird splatters on most walls. The bathroom was the worst area. They did offer to send a maid to clean, but unless it was deep cleaned it wouldn’t have helped much. I will say they respond quickly and try and remedy any complaints I have.

You are also easy walking diistance to countless other shops, including H&M, TJMaxx, Victoria secret, Bed Bath & Beyond all the banks.\n\nThere is also a burgeoning restaurant and cafe scene in the area with places such as Red Rooster by celebrity Chef Marcus Samuelsson only two blocks away. The casual-chic soul food restaurant BLVD Bistro is only steps away from the apartment. Other restaurants that are very close by include Harlem Shake, Sottocase Pizzeria, Barawine, Settepani, Il cafe Latte, Sushi Inoue, Corner Social and the famous soul food classic Sylvia\'s.\n\nThere are two parks nearby, Marcus Garvey park is steps aways and it is only a 12 minute walk to Central Park.\n\nThe building is in a very safe, well-lit area on the widest street in Manhattan. It is unlike other listings that may look beautiful inside, but are down dark side streets or in the less developed areas above 125th street.\nShow more\nHosted by Andrew\nJoined in August 2015\n308 Reviews\nIdentity verified\n\U000f0003\nSuperhost\nI am originally from London but have lived and worked in many countries throughout Europe and Asia as well as Australia and South Africa.

Our community is racially and economically diverse, with many longtime residents coming to live here from throughout the Caribbean. Neighbors try to maintain the Caribbean tradition of civility, so feel free to greet people you pass with a friendly ""good morning"", ""good afternoon"" or ""good evening."" Visitors can enjoy restaurants specializing in food from Trinidad, Jamaica (including both jerk chicken and also Rastafarian vegetarian), Barbados and Haiti - in addition to newer restaurants of all types.\n\nLocated along the East Side of Prospect Park, we are within a 20 minute walk of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Zoo, Museum and Public Library., as well as Grand Army Plaza.\n\nEvery Sunday from April through September Prospect Park hosts the weekly Smorgasburg Food Truck festival, with over 100 food vendors participating. Enter via the Lincoln Road Prospect Park entrance, five minutes away.\n\nGone but not forgotten, the Brooklyn Dodgers ballpark (Ebbets Field) was three blocks from our home until the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958.\nBrooklyn\'s Franklin Avenue restaurant scene is also nearby (a 15-20 minute walk.)\nShow more\nHosted by Claudia\nJoined in November 2010\n230 Reviews\nIdentity verified\n\U000f0003\nSuperhost\nMy husband and I were Airbnb hosts in Manhattan for over five years, and are now happy to host people in our own home in Brooklyn.

There's a 24 grocery store right at the corner - and tons of local bars and restaurants a stone's throw away - Central Park is a pretty short twenty minute walk away - as well as Times Square and Bryant Park - really, this location is gold!\nShow more\nNicole\nOctober 2020\nI had a great 6 week stay at Evan and Maria's place. The apartment is completely renovated, as per the photos, and actually bigger than I expected it to be. It feels like staying in a hotel, but it's nice having the kitchen and dining area if you are planning a longer stay and want to feel more at home. The only negative of the apartment is that there is not much natural light since I spent the weekdays working from home, but if you're a tourist and spending most of the time out, this isn't a drawback at all. There is a grocery store a block away and tons of great bars and restaurants nearby. There is also a cross town bus on the corner and the ferry is just a quick 15 minute walk to get to downtown Manhattan or Brooklyn. The neighborhood and building is quiet and very safe. Evan was always available to answer any questions or concerns I had via text and addressed any minor issues promptly. Would definitely recommend and would book this place again!\nShow more\nLily\nJune 2020\nThis place is great, clean, nice area and great hostess.

Thanks for the great time in NYC!\nShow more\nHerb Brosbe\nSeptember 2021\nI would not rent this apartment until Jase has new keys that actually work. It\'s a real pain to be praying for success as you gently jiggle the key to get it to work. Meanwhile other tenants enter seamlessly with their keys. The building is very old and with a lot of ""delayed maintenance "". It\'s a 4 story walk up with narrow steep steps, so pack lightly. It is a very noisy location, so, if you\'re not city folks, bring ear plugs. On the positive side, Jase is very good at communication. It\'s a cozy nest for two and a great location if you like to walk and enjoy the people watching.\nShow more\nKate\nAugust 2021\nGreat place to stay - truly in the heart of everything.

The location is very close to Times Square and next to quite a few subway stops that are easy to access.

Historically a Jewish and immigrant neighborhood, it was known as a center for anarchism and radical politics throughout the 20th century, and has now been fully gentrified and packed with hipster-baiting cafes, galleries, and shops on every corner. Despite this polished progression, however, the artistic and bohemian spirit that characterized the neighborhood persists, and everything from the coffee shops to the bars has a unique and creative edge. There are endless things to do and see here, so if you’ve got a full day or more, this is the part of NYC where you should do it. (Adapted from Culture Trip)\n\nOur place isn't just all about the LES, however.

Ras Ethiopian vegan eatery, and Savvy's Restaurant with live (Covid-safe) music, and the laundry option WAS AWESOME! I loved staying at Frank's and will be back!\nShow more\nSemira\nMarch 2021\nFrank’s place is definitely a home way from home. You get the entire place to yourself. Great location, close to most subway lines and there are tons of stores around to get groceries and shop. I highly recommend Frank’s place! Would definitely book again anytime i am in the city.\nShow more\nNatasha\nFebruary 2021\nFrank is a great host, his apartment is a great location within walking distance of transportation and restaurants. The building and neighborhood is safe and I would book again in future.\nShow more\nNessa\nJanuary 2021\nFranks place was an excellent choice for my long term stay. Amenities were excellent, everything you could need was there. Home was comfortable and in a mostly quiet location (it's New York so of course there is some noise). Location was fantastic, right around the corner from the 2,3,4,5 train. The neighborhood itself has lots of restaurants and bars. I definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay.\nShow more\nUfjfb\nJuly 2020\nWe stayed for four months in Frank's apartment. The location is fantastic. They have multiple restaurants within walking distance, especially the Chinese restaurant around the corner. Also, the apartment is nearby Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, nearby Manhattan. You can travel using CitiBike, bus or train. The amenities are great, fast wifi, TV and a kitchen if you like to cook. Also, Frank answer fast if you have any questions. We love the apartment that we extended for an additional month. Enjoy all the things Brooklyn has to offer!

This is the part of city where New York's history started, glorious and famous. It is not Carrie Bradshaw's New York. It is rather artistic and informal than glamorous. It is rapidly changing too. This is the place where you will feel a real New York atmosphere.\n\nThey say New York is the city that never sleeps so don't miss it's nightlife. It's happening just a couple blocks away.

The apartment is small but well designed to maximize the usage of the space.\nThe unit is equipped with a private bathroom, a comfortable bed, Cable TV, a desk/dinning table, a fully loaded micro-kitchen, and open closet space. The perfect place for students and young professionals in NYC.\n\n\nOur studio apartment offers our guests the perfect solution to all of New York City\'s lodging hassles... Price, Location, & privacy. With us you can have your own place, in a Manhattan\'s upscale and central location, at an affordable price!\n\nThe Apartment\nThe unit is small (which NYC apartment isn\'t right?) but well equipped with all the amenities needed for a comfortable long stay. The Micro-Kitchen may be tiny but it is fully loaded to bring the inner chef out of you.\nThe comfortable bed will guarantee a good night sleep after a long day out on the city. We provide free Wi-Fi and basic cable to work, study, and stay connected and a nicely remodeled private bathroom and drawers to keep your apartment tidy and organized.\n\nThe building\nOur unit is located in a beautiful 1900\'s historic building that will provide you with a true New York experience. So please keep in mind that this classic building, which is a better word for older, is well maintained but lacks certain amenities that became more popular years after its creation. Stairs are a must, as there is not an elevator in the building and the A/C\'s are located on the windows. The building is located on one of New York busiest Corners, and it has a bar right underneath it.\n\nThe Neighborhood\nOne of the best features of our studio is its location. Step out of the door and enjoy the beautiful architecture, bustling businesses and young feel of the Upper West side.

We are located on Henry Street, close to all tourists attractions so you won't even need to take a train to see the city's best.\n\nIt is：\n30mins subway to Times Square,\n25mins train to Herald Square,\n20mins walk to Brooklyn Bridge, 9/11 Memorial, Statue of Liberty Ferry and\n20mins walk from SoHo with tons of shops and boutiques (shopaholics - stay away!).\n\nYou will never need to go back to the same place to eat, because this area is loaded with restaurants, bars and clubs. This is the part of city where New York's history started, glorious and famous. It is not Carrie Bradshaw's New York. It is rather artistic and informal than glamorous. It is rapidly changing too. This is the place where you will feel a real New York atmosphere.\n\nThey say New York is the city that never sleeps so don't miss it's nightlife. It's happening just a couple blocks away. On Friday and Saturday you can be bar hopping all night and not even leave the neighborhood. There are places to dance as well. Just go out and feel the transformation.\n\nP.S. I spent some time to add a Guidebook to my profile so don't forget to check it out for some suggestions. I hope it will help you to plan your visit.\nShow more\nHosted by Jackie\nJoined in June 2014\n472 Reviews\nIdentity verified\nHey, I’m Jackie - a New Yorker.

The particular room I stayed had a desk and chair. I was able to work comfortably and without any issues. Wifi worked perfectly fine.\n\nLocation: accessible to the F line (which practically takes you anywhere—subject to a few transfers). You’re in NYC—walk. Walking distance to the bars in LES. Walking distance to Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge. Walking distance to East River Park. Major points for being close to Target and Trader Joe’s.\n\nCheck-in process: very thorough and easy to follow. No issues whatsoever.\n\nThe one thing I’d flag is that this is a 3-bedroom, 1 shared bathroom apartment. Though I never had any issues, I was under the impression this was a two-bedroom apt.

They more like pods, so if you struggle with claustrophobia this place is not for you. As someone who camps semi-regularly, it was perfect and the size didn't bother me. The pods do have some shelving and space underneath the mattress for storage. There was a shared common area with food and drinks available. They provide bath towels for the shared bathrooms and showers. If you're looking for comfort and some privacy, this is not the place for you. If you're looking for a hostel/communal style place and are on a budget, this is a perfect spot for a short-term stay in a great location in the city.\nShow more"", '2,301 Reviews', ""Things to know\nHouse rules\nCheckout: 11:00 AM\nSelf check-in with building staff\nNot suitable for children and infants\nNo smoking\nNo parties or events\nShow more\nHealth & safety\nAirbnb's social-distancing and other COVID-19-related guidelines apply\n\U000f1803\nSecurity camera/recording device Show more\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nSmoke alarm\nShow more\nCancellation policy\nAdd your trip dates to get the cancellation details for this stay.\nAdd dates"", '', '', '', '', '']",['House rules\nCheckout: 11:00 AM\nSelf check-in with building staff\nNot suitable for children and infants\nNo smoking\nNo parties or events\nShow more'],"['Self check-in\nYou can check in with the doorman.', 'Great location\n95% of recent guests gave the location a 5-star rating.']","['Languages: English, Español\nResponse rate: 100%\nResponse time: within an hour']",https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12171671?previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=168349e0-ecfc-4f2e-ab18-d8fe49be1043,New-York--NY--United-States/

This highly sought after neighborhood is home to some of the city’s premier museums and cultural landmarks. Fifth Avenue from 82nd to 105th Street is known as Museum Mile, containing the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Jewish Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio and more. While others are hustling and bustling about in the surrounding areas, the serene nature of the Upper East Side will provide a sense of much-needed peace and quiet. Visit Central Park and explore all of the attractions and activities this landmark has to offer such as the Central Park Zoo, the Mall and Literary Walk, the Loeb Boathouse and the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. Take a stroll down Lexington, Park, Madison or 5th Ave and navigate the endless shops, lavish buildings, and delightful restaurants. The Upper East Side’s restaurant scene is incredibly diverse. Whatever you’re craving after a day of museum-hopping or exploring Central Park, you’ll find it here. Try the iconic burger at JG Melon, get dressed up for a fancy French meal at Daniel or slurp noodles at Xi'an Famous Foods. The neighborhood offers a combination of both natural and commercial pleasure.\nShow more\nHosted by Ken\nJoined in October 2014\n688 Reviews\nIdentity verified\nI work for Furnished Quarters, the largest provider of furnished apartments in the Northeast.

It’s also home to many college campuses, including Columbia University and Juilliard. Take a walk through picturesque Central Park, visit the famous Museum of Natural History, see a ballet at Lincoln Center or enjoy an opera at the Met. This opulent neighborhood is a cultural and intellectual hub, as it is the home of various museums, performing arts centers, Barnard College and Columbia University.

With so much to explore and discover, this neighborhood is sure to impress. The famous Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues are reliable destinations for numerous bars, cafes, delicatessens, bakeries, brunch spots and more. It is impossible to go hungry in this neighborhood. The Upper West Side is bordered by Central Park to the east, with proximity to points of interest within the park like Sheep Meadow, Strawberry Fields, Cherry Hill and Belvedere Castle. To the west along the Hudson River is Riverside Park, a 4-mile long waterfront park full of jogging trails, playgrounds, concessions, dog runs and recreational facilities.

You will find, gently-strolling, pedestrian traffic at all hours of the day of evening.\n   Chelsea is not a dark, or dangerous area.   It's a neighborhood that's full of life.\n      Many artists, musicians, writers, actors, FIT students, other graduate students, similar intelligentsia, and creative people live in Chelsea.  I think you'll like it here.\n     You can get anywhere in New York City quickly and easily from here.\n       The subway station is two blocks away (a two minute walk).\nMidtown Manhattan is very central and safe. Police station 2 blocks away. We're located within walking distance of Theater District, Penn Station, FIT, Madison Square Garden, High Line Park  \n     JKF Airport, Newark Airport, and La Guardia Airport all offer fast, direct, public transportation to Penn Station in Manhattan.  Penn Station is a three minute walk from here.\nShow more\nHosted by Alex And Zeena\nJoined in June 2014\n2,301 Reviews\nHi everyone! I'm Alex.

I talked with that guest and she showed me her message with the host which also listed the same room. I was soon put in a room a floor above.

Just a short walk to the bus stop you can get to NYC within minutes. We are the most affordable hotel in the whole area.\n\nThe space\nWe are a town Hotel and we have been open for about 30 years. We have 35 guest rooms and we have a full private/shareable bathroom for the guest rooms that do not have a bathroom. We keep the bathrooms clean daily and we clean the rooms once a week. We also provide Free wifi, Regular HD channels and fresh towels and lines. What makes our Hotel special is the prime location, it truly dose not get any better than where we are. With a short walk to the bus stops you can take a shuttle bus that will cost you only $3 dollars. Within minutes you will arrive to New York City Port authority on 42nd street. From there you can walk a block or two to see the famous Times Square in NYC or many other options to choose from. When you visit New York City there are unlimited places to visit and experience for the first time. Another reason why its best to book with us is that we are the most affordable Hotel in the area. Only $39 a night compared to $79 a night and your 1 mile further than New York City which isn't a good idea, especially with traffic. Come and experience the Big Apple if you have a budget or if you want to splurge it all in NYC instead of your Guest Room.\nShow more\nWhat this place offers\nWifi\nFree street parking\nPets allowed\nTV\nAir conditioning\nHair dryer\nLong term stays allowed\nSecurity cameras on property\nShow all 16 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$50\n / night\n$50 per night\n4.41\n(51 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.41 out of 5 stars from 51 reviews\n4.41 · 51 reviews\nCleanliness\n4.5\nAccuracy\n4.7\nCommunication\n4.7\nLocation\n4.7\nCheck-in\n4.7\nValue\n4.5\nDante\nOctober 2021\nGreat place great value !\nEric\nOctober 2021\nGood:\n1.

Unlimited bus and subway is only $33 per week. We used buses a lot. The Mll goes north on the corner near the flat. I highly recommend this airbnb apartment.\nShow more\nMorgan\nOctober 2021\nMarco's place was very clean and cozy. It was in a great location and just far away enough from the main roads you couldn't hear all the noises when trying to go to sleep. It was close to so many great restaurants and sites.

An influx of immigrants, especially from South Asia and Latin America, arrived in the area in recent years, bringing recipes and distinctive preparations with them. Stuffed Tibetan dumplings, fruity Colombian beverages, spicy Indian chaat and other delicious edibles and drinkables may be had from street carts and established restaurants—even out of the back of a cell phone store. But Jackson Heights offers more than palate-pleasing, belly-bursting food. Every summer it hosts the Queens Pride Parade and Multicultural Festival, and serves as the borough's center of gay culture year-round. Much of the neighborhood is a designated historic district, in recognition of its characteristic garden apartments and urban design. The inventor of Scrabble lived in Jackson Heights; he is memorialized via a Scrabble-esque street sign. Only a few stops on the subway from Midtown Manhattan, this largely residential neighborhood welcomes visitors, priding itself on being the kind of place where people from elsewhere can feel at home, much like New York City itself.\nShow more\nHosted by Angela\nJoined in December 2015\n510 Reviews\nIdentity verified\nHi!

In the big bathroom there are two sets of toilets, showers and sinks so you will be using on the LEFT side of everything by yourself.\nThere are another 3 rooms from which 2 of them are used as art studio spaces on the same floor but most likely you won’t get to see the artists(a female figurative artist and myself) since they barely come to work so only if you are lucky you will get to meet them and see their art!), that to be said, you will find that the top floor very quiet and private.\n.\nShow more\nWhere you'll sleep\nBedroom\n1 single bed\nWhat this place offers\nWifi\nFree street parking\nWasher\nDryer\nAir conditioning\nHair dryer\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nDedicated workspace\nLong term stays allowed\nShow all 28 amenities\nSelect check-in date\nAdd your travel dates for exact pricing\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nSuMoTuWeThFrSa\nNovember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nDecember 2021\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\nClear dates\n$68\n / night\n$68 per night\n4.90\n(80 reviews)\nCHECK-IN\nAdd date\nCHECKOUT\nAdd date\nGUESTS\n1 guest\nCheck availability\nReport this listing\n4.90 out of 5 stars from 80 reviews\n4.90 · 80 reviews\nCleanliness\n5.0\nAccuracy\n5.0\nCommunication\n4.9\nLocation\n4.9\nCheck-in\n4.9\nValue\n4.9\nNadine\nOctober 2021\nVery nice neighborhood, building.\nLindy\nOctober 2021\nNice, small bedroom up several stairs.

Overall a wonderful choice for staying in the city, will book again if I travel down in the future.\nShow more\nChristina\nAugust 2021\nThis place and our host surpassed expectations! Better in every way than a hotel. We had the best sleep in ten years. Conveniently located near subway for quick rides all over the city and very affordable.

We are located on Henry Street, close to all tourists attractions so you won't even need to take a train to see the city's best.\n\nIt is：\n30mins subway to Times Square,\n25mins train to Herald Square,\n20mins walk to Brooklyn Bridge, 9/11 Memorial, Statue of Liberty Ferry and\n20mins walk from SoHo with tons of shops and boutiques (shopaholics - stay away!).\n\nYou will never need to go back to the same place to eat, because this area is loaded with restaurants, bars and clubs. This is the part of city where New York's history started, glorious and famous. It is not Carrie Bradshaw's New York. It is rather artistic and informal than glamorous. It is rapidly changing too. This is the place where you will feel a real New York atmosphere.\n\nThey say New York is the city that never sleeps so don't miss it's nightlife. It's happening just a couple blocks away. On Friday and Saturday you can be bar hopping all night and not even leave the neighborhood. There are places to dance as well. Just go out and feel the transformation.\n\nP.S.

It is bounded by Central Park on the east, the Hudson River on the west, West 59th Street to the south, and West 110th Street to the north.\nThe Upper West Side is an affluent, primarily residential area with many of its residents working in commercial areas of Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Similarly to the Museum Mile district on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side is considered one of Manhattan\'s cultural and intellectual hubs, with Columbia University and Barnard College located just to the north of the neighborhood, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School located at the south end.\n\nTwo New York City Subway corridors serve the Upper West Side. The IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (1, 2, and 3 trains) runs along Broadway. The IND Eighth Avenue Line (A, B, C, and D trains) runs along Central Park West.\n\nThere are five bus routes – M5, M7, M10, M11, M104 buses – that go up and down the Upper West Side, and the M57 goes up West End Avenue for 15 blocks in the neighborhood. Additionally, crosstown routes include the M66, M72, M79 SBS, M86 SBS, M96 and M106. The north–south M20 terminates at Lincoln Center\n\nThe Upper West Side has been a setting for many films and television shows because of its pre-War architecture, colorful community and rich cultural life. Ever since Edward R. Murrow went ""Person-to-Person"" live, the length of Central Park West in the 1950s, West Siders scarcely pause to gape at on-site trailers, and jump their skateboards over coaxial cables.
